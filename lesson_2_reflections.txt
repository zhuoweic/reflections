What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    Generate a .git directory. I need to store the previous version once I start to commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    It serve as a pre-test for developer to think about what files would need to be uploaded. And also add some flexibility for managing files because you no longer need to upload all the files in your local directory.
